Upgrading from Rigel V1 to V2
=============================

Rigel V2 has updated the configuration items used to determine how articles 
are delivered to the IMAP messages, at this time Rigel will read and process
V1 and V2 configuration messages, however it will throw out a warning about
the V1 messages.

You have two choices on how to "upgrade" the configuration messages to the V2
format:

    1. Move the config message to the "Add" folder and manuall update the 
       settings to match the new format (not recommended)
     
    2. Run Rigel with the -R command line option and let it reformat your
       configuration messages.
       
If you have modified other aspects of your configuration messages (like the 
comments) then option 2 will delete those changes and replace them with the 
standard template that can be found in the "Add" folder.

If you are going to let Rigel do the configuration message refresh for you
it is highly recommended that you create a backup copy of the configuration
messages before you do so.  This will ensure you can go back to the previous
configuration at any time.

The automated update will also updated the Help messages as well as the Add
templates to the latest version.

In the future, Rigel will always support the previous major version's 
configuration messages, however two major versions will not be supported.
For example, V2 will support V1 and V2 configuration messages, however V3
will support V2 and V3 messages, V1 will be dropped for supportability.
