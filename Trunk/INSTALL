Rigel Installation
==================

Requirements
------------
        Rigel is a Perl script, so of course it needs Perl, specifically
        Perl 5.8 or above (5.10 is highly recommended for Windows).

        In addition, the following Perl modules are required:

                Crypt::CBC
                Crypt::DES_PP
                Data::Dumper (for debugging only)
                Digest::HMAC
                Encode
                Encode::Guess
                File::Basename
                Getopt::Long
                HTML::Entities
                HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables
                HTML::TreeBuilder
                HTTP::Date
                IO::Socket::SSL (required in case of using IMAP over SSL)
                Jcode
                LWP (LWP::UserAgent, LWP::Simple)
                MIME::Base64
                MIME::Parser
                MIME::Types
                MIME::WordDecoder
                Mail::IMAPClient
                Mail::IMAPClient::BodyStructure
                Text::Unidecode
                XML::FeedPP
                XML::Parser
                XML::Parser::Expat

        Note that XML::FeedPP and MAIL::IMAPClient must be up to the current
        versions (0.40 and 3.21 and this time), previous versions had bugs
        which caused Rigel to fail.

        You also need an IMAP server, Rigel should work with just about any
        IMAP server, however it has only been verified at this time with
        Microsoft Exchange 2003/2007.

        Rigel has been thoroughly tested on OpenSUSE Linux but it should run
        on just about any *nix variant that support Perl and the above modules.

        Rigel has also been test on Windows and it works with ActiveState Perl
        5.10, however not all functionality has been test and ActiveState's
        package manager does not include all of the required packages.  Install
        what you can from ActiveState's package manager and then use cpan to
        install the rest.

Installation
------------
        Since you are reading this you've work out how to download and
        decompress the tarball so we'll skip that step.

        Move Rigel in to the directory you want to use on an ongoing basis.

        Now, edit Rigel.conf, there are lots of options in the file, but
        the important ones are:

                * User - The user name to logon to the IMAP server with
                * Password - The password to logon to the IMAP server with
                * Host - The IMAP server FQDN

        The rest of the settings are optional and you can read the
        descriptions of each in the configuration file.

        For the rest of this document, it will be assumed that you have not
        changed any of the other settings in the configuration file, if you
        have you will have to substitute some of the following instructions
        with the changes you have made.

        NOTE: Pay special attention to the password setting, it should never
        be used.  As Rigel has to decrypt the password to pass it to the IMAP
        server, it is easy for anyone with access to the configuration file to
        decrypt the password and get access to your IMAP account.  The
        password setting is only included for debugging purposes.  If you use
        this setting, don't say I didn't warn you.

        Once complete, we need to run Rigel once to setup the IMAP connection
        and folders to be used, do so as follows:

                perl Rigel -o

        Next logon to your IMAP server with your mail client and you should
        see a series of folders like this:

                +RSS Management
                        +Add
                        +Configuration
                        +Delete
                        +Help
                        +Last Update Info

        Inside the Add folder will be a series of templates to use for adding
        new feeds to your configuration.

        Inside the Help folder will be some example feeds and a general help
        message to get you started.

        The last step is to configure Rigel to run in the background, there are
        two options for this:

                1. Let Rigel fork itself
                2. Use cron or another scheduler

        To let Rigel fork itself, simply run:

                perl Rigel

        Otherwise see your system documentation on how to setup a scheduled
        task.  Make sure that you use -o otherwise you'll spawn multiple
        daemon copies of Rigel which is probably not what you want.

Adding Feeds
------------
        To add a feed, simply edit one of the template messages or create a new
        message in the Add folder.  The message should contain the url of the
        feed you want to add to Rigel as well as any custom configuration you
        want to have for this feed.  You can also see the examples in the Help
        folder as a place to start.

        Once complete, re-run Rigel (or let your scheduler run it for you):

                perl Rigel -o

        This will create the configuration messages in the Configuration folder
        and retrieve the first set of articles from the feeds you have added.

        For more advanced functions, when you create the message in the Add
        folder, you can add additional items to the message body to control how
        this feed will be managed.  For example if you want this feed to be
        stored in a different folder than all your other feeds, simply add the
        following line to the message body:

                folder = Feeds%{dir:sep}Other

        The options that are available are:

                folder
                type
                to
                subject
                from
                delivery-mode
                crop-start
                crop-end
                ignore-dates
                article-order
                expire
                expire-unseen
                expire-folder
                sync
                use-subjects
                force-ttl

        The template add messages have all of these options commented out with
        brief descriptions of them, or you can read the configuration file for
        details on these.

Macros
------
        Some of the settings in the configuration file and the feeds can use
        macros to expand information that will be available at runtime, these
        macros are as follows:

                Macro Name              Description
                %{host}                 Hostname

Delivery mode
-------------
        Rigel can deliver mail in three different delivery modes:

                - Plain Text (text)
                        All items are converted to plain text (7-bit ASCII)
                - Raw Feed (raw, default)
                        Uses whatever the feed provides (usually a mix of
                        text with some HTML markup
                - Embedded HTML (embedded)
                        Creates an HTML doc with an embedded external link
                        to the article (basically shows the web page that
                        the article points to).  As this is an external link
                        you have to be connected to the Internet to see the
                        content in this mode.
                - mhtmllink
                        Retrieve the webpage in the rss link and convert it
                        to a mime HTML mail message with all css and images
                        embedded in the message.  This allows for offline
                        reading, but can generate very large messages.
                - htmllink
                        Retrieve the webpage in the rss link and create an
                        HTML message from it.  This allows for offline
                        reading, but no css or images will be available.
                - textlink
                        Retrieve the webpage in the rss link and create a
                        text message from it.

        You can configure delivery mode by setting "delivery-mode" value in
        Rigel.conf, and can override its value with command line option "-d".
