          two digits

          feed item to ensure they match what is stored in the subject line
          cache
        - HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables is a little flaky,
          encapsulated in a Perl eval so things don't blow up if there is

        - added channel hostname macro

          without a complier!
        - Major code cleanup, function descriptions, function naming
          standards and lots of other internal cleanup, the source code
            almost looks beautiful ;)
        - Converted all modules to be function based instead of object based
        - Renamed the module directory and modules
        - Added Template and IMAP modules
        - Added help folder and feed examples to the IMAP server
        - Added FAQ file
        - Fixed issues with feeds that have UTF8 encoding not getting stored
          in Perl in UTF8 format, causing currupt messages to be stored on
          the IMAP server
        - Added support for log files instead of just console output, including
          log file roll over and dual console/file output
        - Configuraton templates now support various date items
        - Removed old OPML import/export code as it hasn't worked in a long

version 1.0b5
-------------
        - Fixed critical bug where sync mode was forced on for all feeds

version 1.0b4
-------------
        - Added support for TTL's in RSS Feeds
        - Added code to clean feeds of high ascii characters
        - Fixed issue with Courier IMAP

version 1.0b3
-------------
        - removed redundent config file loads
        - removed data::dumper from all .pm files except debug.pm
        - Fixed config file parsing to apply settings to the approrpriate
          site or global config variables only
        - possible bug fix with checking the time stamp on a search where no
          messages exist
        - Added debugging library and support
        - It turns out that you cannot count on UID's being returned form
          append_string() when adding messages to the IMAP server, nor can
          you count on the flag's variable in append_string() actually
          working so this update loops through all messages in the
          configuration and last update folders whenever a change is made
          and marks all messages as seen.
        - also removed the peek setting in the imap server connection code
          as some servers take this to mean to never update the seen status
          no matter what the function being preformed, incudeing a see() call
        - added Ignoresizeerrors to the IMAP connect to support mail servers
          like Exchange 2007
        - added code to check the validity of the subject lines being
          replaced in the last update so if an error occured after the
          connetion to the RSS feed was made and no subjects were actually
          returned the old list of subjects will be used

version 1.0b2
-------------
        - Second Beta
        - Significant changes to the HTML->text converter code to better
          handle the kind of HTML that comes from RSS feeds

          text mode
        - Rigel now requires HTML::Entities
        - Rigel now can cache the subject lines of feed items and use
          them to exclude items as being seen as new

        - Reworked the macro code to strip out any macro that was not
          recognized or contained a blank item
        - The template "add" messages now include a list of all options
          available to be set, commented out by default
        - Fixed an issue that if a configuration message had a blank line
          in it, the parser would treat it as a "reset to default" command
          instead of just a blank line :)
        - Changed delivery modes from text/html to text/raw/embedded, see
          the install file for details
