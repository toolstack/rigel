Rigel V?.? (??? ?, ????)
========================

Welcome to Rigel, an RSS to IMAP gateway
----------------------------------------
        Rigel is designed to be run by a user on their own hardware and
        transfer RSS feeds to an IMAP account of the users choosing.

        Some of Rigel's features include:
                * RSS 0.9, 1.0, 2.0, Atom 0.3 support.
                * Multiple mail formats supported.
                * You can tell Rigel to retrieve the full content and add it
                  to the message instead of the content from the RSS feed.
                * Rigel can retreive any webpage and treat it like an RSS feed.
                * You can unify unread RSS article management via IMAP. This
                  is useful in case of using multiple clients.
                * IMAP over SSL supported.
                * Connect via proxy, proxy authentication supported.
                * Generate IMAP Folder dynamically from every RSS title or
                  other details from the items.
                * Automatically delete expired article.
                * By executing in channel mode, it can work as simple Antenna.
                * Reduce needless traffic by using If-Modified-Since header.
