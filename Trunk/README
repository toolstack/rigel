Rigel V1.0b? (??? ??, 2009)
============================

Welcome to Rigel, an RSS to IMAP gateway
----------------------------------------
        Rigel is designed to be run by a user on their own hardware and
        transfer RSS feeds to an IMAP account of the users choosing.

        Some of Rigels features include:
                * RSS 0.9, 1.0, 2.0, Atom 0.3 support. 
                * text/html, text/plain mail format support. 
                * You can tell Rigel to retrive the full content and add it
                  to the message instead of the content from thr RSS feed.
                * You can unify unread RSS article management via IMAP. This 
                  is useful in case of using multiple client. 
                * IMAP over SSL support 
                * Connect via proxy, proxy authentication support. 
                * Generate IMAP Folder dynamically from every RSS title, and 
                  so on. 
                * Automatically delete expired article. 
                * By executing in channel mode, it can work as simple Antenna. 
                * Reduce needless traffic by using If-Modified-Since header.

Acknowledgement
---------------
        Rigel is a fork from rss2imap, their code, while apparently no 
        longer maintained, is still the core of Rigel, please visit 
        their sourceforge page for more information.

Soapbox
-------
        I hate Perl.  I really, really, really hate Perl.

        However it is really, really, really good for some things.  This
        is one of them.

        Having said that, I'll apologize for the code up front, between
        not having written the vast majority of it (see Acknowledgements
        above) and just hacking in the changes I wanted.
