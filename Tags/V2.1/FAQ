Rigel Frequently Asked Questions
================================

Q: Can Rigel handle multiple IMAP Mailboxes?
--------------------------------------------
A: No, Rigel is designed only to read/write to a single IMAP mailbox.
   Supporting multiple mailboxes is not in the plan for Rigel.


Q: I've added a feed, but new items don't seem to get added, what's going on?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: The most likely cause of this is that Rigel by default looks at the article
   publication date in the feed and compares it to the last time Rigel updated
   the feed.  If the pub date is earlier than the last update time, Rigel
   ignores the article and moves on to the next.

   The problem occurs when feeds set pub dates to some other time than when
   the article was added to the feed.  For example, some feeds are simply
   reflections of blogs, with some time lag between them.  If this kind of feed
   places a pub date based upon when the web page is updated but waits an hour
   or so until the feed gets updated, then the pub date could occur before the
   last time Rigel ran and updated the feed.

   To get around this, simply add the "ignore-dates" setting to the feed in
   question and all articles will be treated as new.  Subject caching will
   then be used as the only methodology to exclude articles from the feed.

Q: I upgraded to V2.1 and Rigel now will not run, what happened?
----------------------------------------------------------------
A: WWW::Shorten is now a required library, please install it and try again.
