	- Second Beta

	  handle the kind of HTML that comes from RSS feeds
	- Rigel now strips HTML from subject lines when delivering in

	  them to exclude items as being seen as new
	- Removed the use of WARN in the code
	- Delivery mode is now a per feed option instead of a global 
	  option
	- Added two new macro's in the configuration file code, %{newline}
	  and %{dashline:}

	  recognized or contained a blank item
	- The template "add" messages now include a list of all options 
	  available to be set, commented out by default
	- Fixed an issue that if a configuration message had a blank line 
	  in it, the parser would treat it as a "reset to default" command
	  instead of just a blank line :)
	- Changed delivery modes from text/html to text/raw/embedded, see
	  the install file for details
	- The add feed code now handles mime messages correctly
