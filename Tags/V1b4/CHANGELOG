Rigel change log:
================

version 1.0b4
-------------
        - Added support for TTL's in RSS Feeds
        - Added code to clean feeds of high ascii characters
        - Fixed issue with Courier IMAP
        - Added date/time to debug output
        - Added support for mhtmllink, htmllink and textlink message types
        - Updated "Template" add message to be more user friendly
        - Enabled "use subjects" by default
        - Updated the "Processing..." line to use the configuration message
          subject line instead of the rss url

version 1.0b3
-------------
        - removed redundent config file loads
        - removed data::dumper from all .pm files except debug.pm
        - Fixed config file parsing to apply settings to the approrpriate
          site or global config variables only
        - possible bug fix with checking the time stamp on a search where no 
          messages exist
        - Added debugging library and support
        - It turns out that you cannot count on UID's being returned form 
          append_string() when adding messages to the IMAP server, nor can
          you count on the flag's variable in append_string() actually 
          working so this update loops through all messages in the 
          configuration and last update folders whenever a change is made 
          and marks all messages as seen.
        - also removed the peek setting in the imap server connection code
          as some servers take this to mean to never update the seen status
          no matter what the function being preformed, incudeing a see() call
        - added Ignoresizeerrors to the IMAP connect to support mail servers
          like Exchange 2007
        - added code to check the validity of the subject lines being 
          replaced in the last update so if an error occured after the
          connetion to the RSS feed was made and no subjects were actually
          returned the old list of subjects will be used

version 1.0b2
-------------
        - Second Beta
        - Significant changes to the HTML->text converter code to better
          handle the kind of HTML that comes from RSS feeds
        - Rigel now strips HTML from subject lines when delivering in 
          text mode
        - Rigel now requires HTML::Entities
        - Rigel now can cache the subject lines of feed items and use
          them to exclude items as being seen as new
        - Removed the use of WARN in the code
        - Delivery mode is now a per feed option instead of a global 
          option
        - Added two new macro's in the configuration file code, %{newline}
          and %{dashline:}
        - Reworked the macro code to strip out any macro that was not
          recognized or contained a blank item
        - The template "add" messages now include a list of all options 
          available to be set, commented out by default
        - Fixed an issue that if a configuration message had a blank line 
          in it, the parser would treat it as a "reset to default" command
          instead of just a blank line :)
        - Changed delivery modes from text/html to text/raw/embedded, see
          the install file for details
        - The add feed code now handles mime messages correctly

version 1.0b1
-------------
        - Initial Beta
        - Based upon rss2imap v0.78 development
        - Moved RSS configuration details to the IMAP server instead
          of a local file
        - Combined the local and site configuration files in
          to a single configuration file
        - Changed logic on feeds so that if you delete an article
          Rigel will not re-add it on the next update
        - General code standardization and removal of of unused code
