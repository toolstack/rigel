Rigel Installation
==================

Requirements
------------
	Rigel is a Perl script, so of course it needs Perl, specifically
	Perl 5.8 or above.

	In addition, the following Perl modules are required:

		Crypt::CBC
		Data::Dumper
		Digest::HMAC
		Encode
		Encode::Guess
		Getopt::Long;
		HTTP::Date
		IO::Socket::SSL(required in case of using IMAP over SSL). 
		Jcode 
		LWP (LWP::UserAgent, LWP::Simple) 
		MIME::Parser
		MIME::WordDecoder
		Mail::IMAPClient 
		Mail::IMAPClient::BodyStructure 
		Unicode::Map8
		XML::FeedPP
		XML::Parser 
		XML::Parser::Expat
		XML::RSS 

	Note that XML::FeedPP and MAIL::IMAPClient must be up to the current 
	versions (0.34 and 3.05 and this time).  

	XML::FeedPP 0.34 also has an issue with some date formats as provided 
	by some feeds, this will be fixed in the next release of FeedPP.

	You also need an IMAP server, Rigel should work with just about any 
	IMAP server, however it has only been verified at this time with 
	Microsoft Exchange 2003. 

	Rigel has only been tested on Linux at this time but it should run on
	just about any *nix variant that support Perl and the above modules.
	Rigel has not yet been test on Windows and it is unlikely to work at
	this time.

Installation
------------
	Since you are reading this you've work out how to download and 
	decompress the tarball so we'll skip that step.

	Move Rigel in to the directory you want to use on an ongoing basis.

	Now, edit Rigel.conf, there are lots of options in the file, but
	the important ones are:

		* User - The user name to logon to the IMAP server with
		* Password - The password to logon to the IMAP server with
		* Host - The IMAP server FQDN

	The rest of the settings are optional and you can read the 
	descriptions of each in the configuration file.

	For the rest of this document, it will be assumed that you have not
	changed any of the other settings in the configuration file, if you 
	have you will have to substitute some of the following instructions
	with the changes you have made.

	NOTE: Pay special attention to the password setting, it should never
	be used.  As Rigel has to decrypt the password to pass it to the IMAP
	server, it is easy for anyone with access to the configuration file to
	decrypt the password and get access to your IMAP account.  The 
	password setting is only included for debugging purposes.  If you use
	this setting, don't say I didn't warn you.

	Once complete, we need to run Rigel once to setup the IMAP connection 
	and folders to be used, do so as follows:

		perl Rigel -o

	Next logon to your IMAP server with your mail client and you should 
	see a series of folders like this:

		+RSS Management
			+Add
			+Configuration
			+Delete
			+Last Update Info

	Inside the Add folder will be a series of templates to use for adding
	new feeds to your configuration.

	The last step is to configure Rigel to run in the background, there are
	two options for this:

		1. Let Rigel fork itself
		2. Use cron or another scheduler

	To let Rigel fork itself, simply run:

		perl Rigel

	Otherwise see your system documentation on how to setup a scheduled 
	task.  Make sure that you use -o otherwise you'll spawn multiple 
	daemon copies of Rigel which is probably not what you want.

Adding Feeds
------------
	To add a feed, simply edit one of these templates or create a new 
	message in the Add folder.  The message should simply contain the url
	of the feed you want to add to Rigel.

	Once complete, re-run Rigel

		perl Rigel -o

	This will create the configuration messages in the Configuration folder
	and retrieve the first set of articles from the feeds.

	For more advanced functions, when you create the message in the Add 
	folder, you can add additional items to the message body to control how
	this feed will be managed.  For example if you want this feed to be
	stored in a different folder than all your other feeds, simply add the 
	following line to the message body:

		folder = Feeds%{dir:sep}Other

	The options that are available are:

		folder
		type
		sync
		expire
		expire-unseen
		expire-folder
		subject
		from

	See the configuration file for details on these.

Macros
------
	Some of the settings in the configuration file and the feeds can use
	macros to expand information that will be available at runtime, these
	macros are as follows:

		Macro Name		Description
		%{host}			Hostname 
		%{user}			Username 
		%{rss-link}		RSS URL 
		%{dir:sep}		The IMAP server's folder separator
		%{dir:manage}		The folder that Rigel stores it's
					management items in
		%{dir:lastmod}		The folder that Rigel stores the RSS
					last modified information in
		%{last-modified}	Last-Modified header which web server 
					returns.
		%{item:link}		Link value of every RSS item.
		%{item:title}		Title of every RSS item.
		%{item:description}	Description of every RSS item
		%{item:dc:date}		dc:date of every RSS item.(undefined 
					in some RSS)
		%{item:dc:subject}	dc:subject of every RSS item.(undefined
					in some RSS)
		%{item:dc:creator}	dc:creator of every RSS item.(undefined
					in some RSS)
		%{channel:link}		Link of RSS channel.
		%{channel:title}	Title of RSS channel.
		%{channel:description}	Description of RSS channel.
		%{channel:dc:date}	dc:date of RSS channel. (undefined in 
					some RSS)

Delivery mode
-------------
	Rigel can deliver mail in either "text delivery mode" which delivers 
	plain text mail or "HTML delivery mode" which delivers html mail. 

	HTML delivery mode is useful when you read mail with MUA which have 
	functionality of the HTML inline presentation. Whereas in text delivery
	mode, Rigel can deliver text/plain mail for those who dislike html 
	mail.

	You can configure delivery mode by setting "delivery-mode" value in 
	Rigel.conf, and can override its value with command line option "-d".
